Summary: OpenDingux Emulators

Due to the closure of the `dingoonity` forums,
the list of emulators I previously listed on the relevant page no longer exists.
Here I will list some of the `Opendingux` emulator lists that I have modified and maintained.

Devices marked as `Rx9x` represent support for both `RS90` (Retromini) and `RG99` devices.
Note that, depending on the emulator implementation,
`RS90` and `RG99` may be supported in a single opk or in two separate opks.
